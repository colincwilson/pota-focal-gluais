# Pota Focal House Glossary

The 'House Glossary' is an Irish-English dictionary for learners of Irish which forms the main part of my website [Pota Focal](http://www.potafocal.com/). It contains over 5,000 entries covering the basic vocabulary of the language. The entire contents is available here for download as raw data in XML format for anybody who wants to use it for linguistics research, for statistical purposes, and so on.

## Format

I hope the XML structure will be pretty self-explanatory once you have read through a few articles and cross-checked the XML tags with what they look like on [Pota Focal](http://www.potafocal.com/). If you need a more detailed explanation of anything, get in touch.
